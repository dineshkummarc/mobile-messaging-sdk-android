InfobipRtcUi is an easy-to-use library that allows you to connect to the [Infobip RTC](https://github.com/infobip/infobip-rtc-android) by building a library.

This guide assumes that you have already set up your account and your mobile app profile with [Mobile Push Notifications](https://github.com/infobip/mobile-messaging-sdk-android/blob/master/README.md) and the [Infobip RTC](https://www.infobip.com/docs/voice-and-video/webrtc#getstartedwith-rtc-sdk).

InfobipRtcUi takes care of everything: the registration of your device to receive and trigger calls and handling of the calls themselves. It also offers you a powerful user interface with every feature your customer may need:

- the ability to capture video through both, front and back camera,
- an option to mute and use the speaker,
- the ability to capture and share a screen of a mobile device,
- an option to minimize the call UI in a picture-on-picture mode, and more.

InfobipRtcUi also allows you to take control at any step of the flow, if you wish or need so. How you handle the calls is up to you. You can become a delegate for the [FirebaseMessagingService](https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/android/com/google/firebase/messaging/FirebaseMessagingService) or use your own custom user interface.
